# Smoke test for Apache Cassandra using the DataStax Drivers

Run a subset of the integration test suite of each DataStax driver in order to smoke test Apache Cassandra releases.

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/c09co44clqh06t2k/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/DataStax/cassandra-drivers-smoke-test/branch/master)

## Environment variables

The build requires two environment variables to be set: `SERVER_PACKAGE_URL` and `CCM_VERSION`.

For example:

```bash
export SERVER_PACKAGE_URL=https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/cassandra/3.11.6/apache-cassandra-3.11.6-bin.tar.gz
export CCM_VERSION=3.11.6
```

## AppVeyor Project

https://ci.appveyor.com/project/DataStax/cassandra-drivers-smoke-test/

The environment variables on AppVeyor are set using the [Settings
 UI](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/DataStax/cassandra-drivers-smoke-test/settings).
 
## Other CI Service Providers

This project currently uses [AppVeyor](https://www.appveyor.com/), if needed, it can easily be migrated to other CI
 Service Provider as all the logic on `install.sh` is provider agnostic.
